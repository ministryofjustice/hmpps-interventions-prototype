He is currently on license for an offence of supplying class A drugs as part of a county lines gang A712$**. In this offence the driver of the gang would take him to the Saturn Pub in Space Town in his pink ford focus Reg no ABC 123Y. He would wait at the entrance wearing a green baseball cap so people would know to approach him for drugs. He would sell heroin, cocaine and cannabis, which he kept in a NIKKK backpack.

Since release he is on a methadone script and requires support and encouragement to continue with it as historically, he relapses quickly after release. Following his last sentence his child Purple Trumpet (who had been with a foster family (Avril & Teal Timpani) has been adopted to a family in the Acorn area of Oaktree Village so that he can continue to attend Oaktree School where he has been since being in foster care.
