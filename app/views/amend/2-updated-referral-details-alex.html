Silver Cymbal has a history of offending since the age of 14. He is currently on
license for an offence of supplying class A drugs as part of a county lines gang
A712$**.
In this offence the driver of the gang would take him to the Saturn Pub in Space
Town in his pink ford focus Reg no ABC 123Y. He would wait at the entrance
wearing a green baseball cap so people would know to approach him for drugs.
He would sell heroin, cocaine and cannabis, which he kept in a NIKKK
backpack. When the police arrested him, he threw the backpack at the officer –
missing him and ran away, but he gave chase and arrested him around the
corner in the garden of Moon Beam’s house. Forrest Mercury the car driver was
also arrested and charged with drug related offences.
A number of gang members are still in custody servicing longer sentences.
However, he is both fearful of members in the community and at risk of
returning to offending. He says that he carries a knife in case he bumps into
any gang member and has been warned not to do so by PC999 Plod, his local
officer (mob-0123 987654). He previously had a relationship with one gang
member Orange Trumpet who is the mother of his son Purple (Dob: 10:11:13). Her
new partner is Gold Viola, and they have a child Yellow Trumpet Dob: 21:02:17)
He has recently been released from custody and is residing with his sister
(also known to probation) but this is only temporary.
He has no other family member who he can reside with and although his
family support him, they do not offer the pro-social influence required to keep him
from offending.
Since release he is on a methadone script and requires support and
encouragement to continue with it as historically, he relapses quickly after
release.
Following his last sentence his child Purple Trumpet (who had been with a foster
family (Avril & Teal Timpani) has been adopted to a family in the Acorn area of
Oaktree Village so that he can continue to attend Oaktree School where he has
been since being in foster care. He is struggling to come to terms with this.
