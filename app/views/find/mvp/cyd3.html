                Given the circumstances of the index offence, previous breaches of the restraining order and details of domestic abuse call-outs, I assess that Mr. Alex River's offending does cross the threshold for causing serious harm to the victim and his behaviour suggests that he has the potential to reoffend in a similar manner. <br><br>
                Known adult - Mr Alex River is assessed as posing a high risk of harm to known adult, Ms Jenny Spark, the victim. This is in regard to domestic abuse. The nature of the harm relates to physical, psychological, emotional and financial. Incidents have included intimidation, verbal arguments, physical assaults, with one occasion it is detailed that Mr Alex River had his hands around Ms Jenny Spark's neck. Since a restraining order has been put in place, Mr Alex River and Ms Jenny Spark the victim have appeared to disregard the order, having regular breaches of the order since it was imposed.<br><br>
                Public - Mr Alex River is assessed as posing a medium risk of harm to the public in regard to future partners. This is in relation to domestic abuse concerns which is likely to cause physical, psychological and emotional harm.<br><br>

                Known adult - Risk is likely to be at its greatest, should Mr Alex River continue to show a complete disregard for the restraining order put in place. Risk is also likely to be at its greatest, should Mr Alex River be around Ms Jenny Spark.<br><br>
                Public - Risk is likely to be at its greatest, should Mr. Alex River enter into a new intimate relationship. This would raise concerns around risk of domestic abuse. Risk is likely to be at its greatest to the general public, should Mr. Alex River be involved in any form of altercation of disagreement. Risk is also likely to be at its greatest, should Mr Alex River fail to address attitudes which condone racial abuse.<br><br>
                Staff - Risk is likely to be at its greatest, should Mr. Alex River be involved in a verbal or physical altercation, which requires Police Attendance.<br><br>
                Children - Risk is likely to be greatest, should any child, be present during any domestic incident. Risk is likely to be at its greatest, should they find themselves in the middle of or intervene in any physical domestic incident. Mr Alex River does not spend time around any children currently and has a low risk of serious harm. <br><br>
                Himself - Risk is likely to be at its greatest, should Mr Alex River's mental health deteriorate. At the moment, Mr Alex River tells me he is managing well at the moment, raising no concerns around self harm or suicide.<br><br>
                I do not assess the risk to be currently imminent. I have spoken to Mr Alex River in detail and he claims that he has no interntions of having any contact with Ms Jenny Spark. Previously, Mr Alex River has stated that he has no intention of staying away from Ms Jenny Spark as he loves her, however more recently, Mr Alex River has stated that he understands the restraining order and has no interntion of having any contact.
                Additionally, Mr Alex River tells me that he is currently managing his anger better.

          Mr River does hold attitudes and values that support the use of aggression and violence in response to conflict, both towards members of the public who challenge him and towards Mandy.
          <br><br>
          This risk will continue as long as he holds these attitudes. The same distortions can be seen in his problem-solving skills and particularly when he perceives threats or slights from others, either toward himself or towards his peers. Mr River does not stop to consider the situation more carefully or does not think of the long-term consequences for himself and for others.
          <br><br>
          For as long as Mr River continues to frequent with pro-criminal associates, and be influenced by them, his anti-social attitudes are more likely to remain and potential conflict situations are more likely to occur. This will be even more pronounced when he is under the influence of drug and / or alcohol and long as he continues to consume alcohol to unmanageable levels and take illicit drugs, the risk will remain. This may affect not only the risk he poses to others, but also the risk he poses to himself.
          <br>
          Mr River has identified concerns in relation to his mental health but is reluctant to address this. Until Mr River addressing this area and engages in the treatment he needs, and address the areas that are a source of anxiety for him, the risk will remain. It is particularly relevant in terms of his paranoia as this is directly linked to his domestically abusive behaviour. Although Mr River has drawn the link between substance misuse, paranoia, anti-social thinking and aggressive behaviour, until he address’ these areas, the risk will remain.
          <br><br>
          If, in general, Mr River fails to engage with his OM and / or his licence conditions, this may result in an increase in risk. Similarly, should he fail to engage in a meaningful manner with any of the professional services in place to addresses his problematic behaviour and protect others, this may also increase the risk. This is specifically important around the welfare and safeguarding of his Mandy and Chloe, as any failure to comply with any conditions set out by CSC, adult or any other safeguarding measures could potentially increase risk.
          <br><br>
          Should Mr River resume his relationship with Mandy in the absence of any adult and child safeguarding measures, risk to Mandy and Chloe are likely to increase. Additionally, for as long as Mr River minimises his actions and their consequences in relation to domestic abuse, risk is more likely. Likewise, should Mr River form any new intimate relationships without addressing his attitudes and behaviours and in the absence of any safeguarding and monitoring measures, the risk to any future intimate partners (and to any children present) is likely to increase.

          Mr River currently lives with his uncle Mr AC (tel 00XX00) who is supportive and a protective factor.
          <br><br>
          The OM will manage all aspects of Mr River’s licence including any enforcement issues. The OM will also be responsible for engaging Mr River and encouraging him to engage in offence focused work, comply with his licence conditions, engage with other agencies and help him maintain his motivation. This will be done through rapport building, motivational interviewing and supportive authority. The OM will work with Mr River to increase his protective factors and build on his strengths all of which will give him the skills to manage his behaviour more appropriately when faced with high risk situation.
          <br><br>
          Several areas have been highlighted as linked to risk. Many of the factors interlink i.e. his poor conflict resolution and problem-solving skills impact on both children and known adult - Chloe and Mandy and has resulted in domestically abusive behaviour - and members of the public which result in his violent offending behaviour in general. This is further underpinned by his attitudes which allow him to act this way, believing this is acceptable behaviour. This is one of the first pieces of work that should be undertaken as it will reduce the risk to the three categories outlined. There are specific areas of work that will be done by the OM to address the areas linked to risk, and these will inform weekly supervision sessions. To achieve this the OM will engage Mr River in cognitive behavioural work that will allow Mr River to recognise physical and emotional changes within himself that lead to conflict and then how to address these feelings in an appropriate manner that reduce conflict and stress for himself and others. This eventually will become a protective factor for Mr River as his problem-solving ability increases and his can make more appropriate choices and more appropriate choices.
          <br><br>
          I believe that once the work above is undertaken, his attitudes will begin to change as he will begin to recognise the unacceptability of these attitudes that allow him to behaviour in the way he has. That said, this area is also linked to his general use of violence and the acceptability of using such. Again, it is hoped that his increased skills in problem solving and addressing conflict will reduce this. However, there is also a strong link to his peer influence and more specifically his misplaced loyalty towards defending peers when he perceives a slight against them. Perspective and assertiveness work may be needed to address this.
          <br><br>
          Mr River acknowledges that he uses substances to help him cope, especially when it comes to personal issues and talking about these. He is currently substance free but believes that he no longer needs any assistance in this area. This appears unrealistic as his resolve is yet to be tested in a high-risk situation where he is struggling to cope or being tempted to use drugs and / or alcohol, probably from peers. Mr River will be encouraged to engage with the substance misuse services.
          <br><br>
          In terms of lifestyles and associates, Mr River can be strongly influenced by his peers. This seems to stem from his feelings of distorted loyalty and may stem from the death of his mother. Mr River could do little to help his mother so now forms a strong bond with his peers and will defend then no matter what. I also believe that there may be some element of feeling accepted by his peers give the rejection from his father and brother. Regardless, this leads to offending behaviour and more specifically harm to others.
          <br><br>
          A further intervention is around his emotional well-being and unwillingness to address this. Links have already been made with his GP and the CMHT but Mr River needs further motivation to attend these appointments and follow the advice of these health professionals. ..................
