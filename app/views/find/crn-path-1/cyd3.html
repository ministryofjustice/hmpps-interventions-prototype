              Given the circumstances of the index offence, previous breaches of the restraining order and details of domestic abuse call-outs, I assess that Mr. Alex River's offending does cross the threshold for causing serious harm to the victim and his behaviour suggests that he has the potential to reoffend in a similar manner. <br><br>
              Known adult - Mr Alex River is assessed as posing a high risk of harm to known adult, Ms Jenny Spark, the victim. This is in regard to domestic abuse. The nature of the harm relates to physical, psychological, emotional and financial. Incidents have included intimidation, verbal arguments, physical assaults, with one occasion it is detailed that Mr Alex River had his hands around Ms Jenny Spark's neck. Since a restraining order has been put in place, Mr Alex River and Ms Jenny Spark the victim have appeared to disregard the order, having regular breaches of the order since it was imposed.<br><br>
              Public - Mr Alex River is assessed as posing a medium risk of harm to the public in regard to future partners. This is in relation to domestic abuse concerns which is likely to cause physical, psychological and emotional harm.<br><br>
              Staff - Mr Alex River is assessed as posing a low level of harm to the staff, specifically police officers.<br><br>
              Children - Mr Alex River does not spend time around any children currently and has a low level of harm to children. <br><br>

              Known adult - Risk is likely to be at its greatest, should Mr Alex River continue to show a complete disregard for the restraining order put in place. Risk is also likely to be at its greatest, should Mr Alex River be around Ms Jenny Spark.<br><br>
              Public - Risk is likely to be at its greatest, should Mr. Alex River enter into a new intimate relationship. This would raise concerns around risk of domestic abuse. Risk is likely to be at its greatest to the general public, should Mr. Alex River be involved in any form of altercation of disagreement. Risk is also likely to be at its greatest, should Mr Alex River fail to address attitudes which condone racial abuse.<br><br>
              Staff - Risk is likely to be at its greatest, should Mr. Alex River be involved in a verbal or physical altercation, which requires Police Attendance.<br><br>
              Children - Risk is likely to be greatest, should any child, be present during any domestic incident. Risk is likely to be at its greatest, should they find themselves in the middle of or intervene in any physical domestic incident. Mr Alex River does not spend time around any children currently and has a low risk of serious harm. <br><br>
              Himself - Risk is likely to be at its greatest, should Mr Alex River's mental health deteriorate. At the moment, Mr Alex River tells me he is managing well at the moment, raising no concerns around self harm or suicide.<br><br>
              I do not assess the risk to be currently imminent. I have spoken to Mr Alex River in detail and he claims that he has no interntions of having any contact with Ms Jenny Spark. Previously, Mr Alex River has stated that he has no intention of staying away from Ms Jenny Spark as he loves her, however more recently, Mr Alex River has stated that he understands the restraining order and has no interntion of having any contact.
              Additionally, Mr Alex River tells me that he is currently managing his anger better.
