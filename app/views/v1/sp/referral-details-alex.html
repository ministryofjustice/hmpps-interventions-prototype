            Previous Convictions:
numerous acquisitive offences since the age of 14 –

Possession of class A drug (heroin) x 2;
Criminal damage x 1;

Silver Cymbal has a history of offending since the age of 14. She is currently on
license for an offence of supplying class A drugs as part of a county lines gang
A712$**.
In this offence the driver of the gang would take her to the Saturn Pub in Space
Town in his pink ford focus Reg no ABC 123Y. She would wait at the entrance
wearing a pink baseball cap so people would know to approach her for drugs.
She would sell heroin, cocaine and cannabis, which she kept in a NIKKK
backpack. When the police arrested her, she threw the backpack at the officer –
missing him and she ran away, but he gave chase and arrested her around the
corner in the garden of Moon Beam’s house. Forrest Mercury the car driver was
also arrested and charged with drug related offences.
A number of gang members are still in custody servicing longer sentences.
However, she is both fearful of members in the community and at risk of
returning to offending. She says that she carries a knife in case she bumps into
any gang member and has been warned not to do so by PC999 Plod, her local
officer (mob-0123 987654). She previously had a relationship with one gang
member Orange Trumpet who is the father of her son Purple (Dob: 10:11:13). His
new partner is Gold Viola, and they have a child Yellow Trumpet Dob: 21:02:17)
Colleen has recently been released from custody and is residing with her sister
(also known to probation) but this is only temporary as she has indicated that the
is in the early stages of pregnancy and her sister is unable to support this.
Colleen has no other family member who she can reside with and although her
family support her, they do not offer the pro-social influence required to keep her
from offending.
Since release Colleen is on a methadone script and requires support and
encouragement to continue with it as historically, she relapses quickly after
release.
Following her last sentence her child Purple Trumpet (who had been with a foster
family (Avril & Teal Timpani) has been adopted to a family in the Acorn area of
Oaktree Village so that he can continue to attend Oaktree School where he has
been since being in foster care. She is struggling to come to terms with this.
