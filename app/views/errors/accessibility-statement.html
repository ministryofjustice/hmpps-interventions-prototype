      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="non-compliance-with-the-accessibility-regulations">Non-compliance with the accessibility regulations</h3>
      <p class="govuk-body">Some images do not have a text alternative, so people using a screen reader cannot access the information. This fails WCAG 2.2 success criterion 1.1.1 (non-text content).</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">We plan to add text alternatives for all images by September 2022. When we publish new content we’ll make sure our use of images meets accessibility standards.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">We’ve assessed the cost of fixing the issues with navigation and accessing information. We believe that doing so now would be a disproportionate burden within the meaning of the accessibility regulations.
